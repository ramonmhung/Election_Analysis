## Challenge Overview 

For the secondary part of the Colorado election analysis we proceeded to calculate:

   - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
   
 3. Largest County Turnout: Denver
 
 4. Candidate Results 
 
     - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
     - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
     - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
    
 
 5. 
     - Winner: Diana DeGette
     - Winning Vote Count: 272,892
     - Winning Percentage: 73.8%

- The script developed could be used in other elections if the original data format is similar. This script can only be applied in elections that used the same methodology as the colorado election board to determine the winner.
